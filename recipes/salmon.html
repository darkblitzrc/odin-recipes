        <h3>An easy grilled salmon recipe!</h3>
        <p>Aside from pizza and spaghetti, I'd say that this particular grilled salmon recipe is one of the meals that I prepare most frequently for my family.</p>
        <p>It's my easy go-to when I feel like we need something nutritious, but I don't want to spend much time in the kitchen. Every boy in my house will clean his plate -- no questions asked -- which is certainly not always the case with other dinners that I serve.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 to 3 pounds skin-on salmon fillets (about 5 to 8 ounces per person)</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if cooking gluten-free)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl. If sugar is an ingredient in the marinade you are using, stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li><p>Cut fillets 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Place marinade ingredients in a large casserole dish (or a plate with sides so the marinade doesn't run). Coat the salmon fillets in the marinade and then place them flesh-side down in the marinade.</p>
            <p>Marinate for 20 minutes for a quick marinade (you can do this at room temperature while you are preparing the grill) or if you have more time, from 1 to 2 hours in the refrigerator.</p>
            <p>Before grilling, remove fillets from marinade and discard the marinade. Generously rub or brush oil on both sides of fish fillets.</p></li>
            <li><p>Prepare the grill for high direct heat (if you are using a charcoal grill, prepare one side of the grill for high direct heat and the other side with fewer coals for indirect heating).</p>
            <p>When the grill is hot (you should be able to hold your hand one inch above the grill grates for only 1 second), brush the grill grates with oil. (The best way to do that is to fold up a paper towel, dip in oil, and use tongs to rub the folded up paper towel on the grill grates.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Place salmon fillets on grill, flesh side down (skin-side up) first, so that the fillets can get nice grill marks on the hot grill while the fish is still firm. Close the grill lid. Cook 1 to 3 minutes on the first side, depending on how thick the fillets are.</p>
            <p>Once the fish fillets have been placed on the grill, do not move them until you are going to flip them over. Otherwise, they may fall apart.</p></li>
            <li><p>Look for grill marks on the fish and a small layer of opaque (cooked) fish where the fish is closes to the grill. Using tongs, and a metal spatula to help if necessary, carefully turn the fish onto the other side, so that the skin side is now on the grill grates.</p>
            <p>If you are using a charcoal grill, the fillets should be placed on the side of the grill furthest from the coals. If you are using a gas grill, just reduce the flame to medium.</p>
            <p>Close the grill lid. Cook for another 2-5 minutes, again depending on the thickness of the fillets. Salmon should be just barely opaque throughout when done.</p></li>
        </ol>
